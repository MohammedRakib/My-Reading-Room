		      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

		      <h3>1.1 Purpose </h3>
		      <p>Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the
		        system or a single subsystem</p>

		      <h3>1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
		      <p>Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities for higher-level requirements are assumed to be
		        inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.</p>

		      <h3>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
		      <p>Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized.
		        Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.</p>

		      <h3>1.4 Product Scope</h3>
		      <p>Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is
		        available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.</p>

		      <h3>1.5 References</h3>
		      <p>List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough
		        information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.</p>

		    <span id="Overall_Description">
		      <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>

		      <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
		      <p>Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If
		        the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall
		        system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.</p>

		      <h3>2.2 Product Functions</h3>
		      <p>Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them
		        understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective</p>

		      <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
		      <p>Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational
		        level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to
		        satisfy.</p>

		      <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
		      <p>Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications;
		        specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization
		        will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software)</p>

		      <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
		      <p>Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications;
		        specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization
		        will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).</p>

		      <h3>2.6 User Documentation</h3>
		      <p>List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.</p>

		      <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
		      <p>List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment,
		        or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another
		        project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).</p>

		    <span id="External_Interface_Requirements">
		      <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>

		      <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
		      <p>Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints,
		        standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface
		        design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.</p>

		      <h3>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
		      <p>Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between
		        the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.</p>

		      <h3>3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
		      <p>Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages
		        coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that
		        will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.</p>
